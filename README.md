**What I Do**

1. I self-created SRS documents for modules like Registration & Login.

2. I designed test scenarios and wrote detailed test cases from scratch.

3. I focused on requirement analysis and documentation to simulate a real QA workflow.

4. Although I have not executed the test cases due to the absence of an actual application, I built a complete QA project structure (SRS → Scenarios → Test Cases → Bug Report format).

5. This helped me improve my test case writing, scenario coverage, and documentation skills.

6. .
